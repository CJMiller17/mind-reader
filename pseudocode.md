//There should 6 pages: 
    1. Provocation
    2. Inst
    3. Inst
    4. Inst
    5. Icons
    6. Reveal
Have variables and functions
    button that switches page
        if this page, show this carousel, otherwise show this.
        Maybe have some sort of CSS transition occur.
How to keep state?
Scramble icons depending previous attempts?
    Always have 9 returned, 
        then have a random number +,-,*,/, 
        then have the result show the corresponding number
        Icons must be indexed then in order to call them correctly.
